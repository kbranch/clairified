# Clairified

Clairified is a damage calculator for [Expedition 33: Clair Obscur](https://www.expedition33.com/). Thanks to [Kimjsd's Enhanced Descriptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/134) mod for the underlying data.

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbranch/clairified), which is also a great place for bug reports. **Contributions are welcome!** Adding skills, luminas, weapons, buffs, and even characters can be done with little technical experience.

**Note: This is currently early in development.** A lot of data is missing, and most of the math has not been validated. If you understand how the game does its calculations, your help would be much appreciated!

##### Getting Started
###### 1) Enter stats and buffs

Start by entering your character's total Attack Power and Critical Rate. This information can be found in the top right corner of the character's equipment screen in-game.

Also select which buffs are active (e.g. Powerful, Defenceless, active Stains, etc.), both on your character and on the enemy (target).

###### 2) Select Luminas and a weapon

Below the buffs section, select the Luminas tab and choose which Luminas you have equipped.

Switch to the Weapons tab and select which level upgrades your weapon currently has.

###### 3) Review skill damage

That's it! Now the Skills section will display information about the damage done by each skill, and how those numbers are calculated.
